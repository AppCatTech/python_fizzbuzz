Test Driven Development - Tdd
    Red - Write just enough test code to have a valid failing test
    Green - Implement functionality specified in test
    Refactor - Improve structure without changes to functionality.

    Todo List: (Not usually mentioned...)
        Part of what Test Driven development does for us,
        is that it allows us to keep only one thing at a time in our heads.
        For example...
            At one time we are writing a test to specify correct behavior.
            After than we focus only on writing the functionality needed to pass the test...
            At last we improve design. One thing at a time

        The todo list helps in the same way.

        As we get ideas, or think of things, we jot them down.  This helps us focus too.

What is Fizz Buzz?
    Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
    But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number
    and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.
    For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
